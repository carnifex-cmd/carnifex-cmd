# 👋 Yo, I’m Shardul Sawant

👨‍💻 Fullstack Developer | 🧠 Code Whisperer | ⚡ Speed Optimizer

I architect experiences that load fast, scale well, and quietly impress.  
By day, I’m engineering fullstack solutions that make systems smoother and faster than you'd expect.  
By night, I’m building tools I wish already existed, cleaning up legacy code, or chasing pixels until they behave.

## ⚙️ What I Do

🧠 **Engineer** — I build things that work. Then make them better.  
🌍 **Collaborate** — Across teams, timezones, and tech stacks.  
🧪 **Experiment** — From UX polish to backend overhauls.  
📈 **Optimize** — Turning milliseconds into magic.

**Languages:** JavaScript, Python  
**Frontend:** Vue, React, Redux  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
**Infra & Tooling:** GitLab CI/CD, Docker, Webpack, SSR  
**Philosophy:** Ship fast. Debug smart. Sleep occasionally.

## 🎧 Life Outside Dev

Outside the world of commits and console logs, I love getting lost in music and heading out on long drives — it’s my way of resetting.  
And when I’m in the mood for a bit of digital mischief, you’ll find me blowing off steam in GTA (yes, the traffic rules are optional).
